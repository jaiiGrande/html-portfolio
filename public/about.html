<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>There's much to convey about me but words can't illustrate my true identity. However, I shall begin this journey.  </p>

<p>Jaii is the name I go by and Houston, TX is currently the place I call home.  As an adolescent I grew up in a small town, across the Rappahannock River, known as Warsaw, Virginia. I am the youngest of three with two older sisters.  When it was time for high school in 2006, I found myself living in Mechanicsville, Virginia.  Approximately an hour away from each other with more than 3000 more students than I am used to! </p>
