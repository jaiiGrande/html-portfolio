<h1>Now these movies are IT! not the movie It!</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Life (1999)</h3>
<p> You can never go wrong with a classic Eddie Murphy and Martin Lawrence movie.  Over 40 years they served a life sentence for a crime they did not commit.  Over the years they learn each other and themselves most importantly.  You will laugh as they take you on their journey of life. </p>

<h3>Lion King (1994)</h3>
<p> How can someone not enjoy the lively singing of lions, hyenas, and a loyal bird?  This one I really loved growing up and even named my dog after Nala!  This one is a pure classic for all ages to watch and enjoy!  Sit back with the popcorn, chocolate, beer, or whatever and be prepared to sing along. </p>

<h3>Ace Venture: When Nature Calls (1995)</h3>
<p>Oh Jim Carey.  I can say his name and begin to smile because of how well he plays this character.  Honestly, who could ever remake Ace Ventura?? This movie was his another one of his while adventures that he takes on.  While in Africa he has to find a missing sacred bat that could cause a war amongst the local tribes if not found before the wedding.  When I tell you, that this is funny from beginning to end, I am not joking!</p>
